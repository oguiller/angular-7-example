<!--
  With this change (adding the trackBy), the ngFor directive will know that the Product that is removed from the
  array using the swapProduct method defined in Listing 13-12 is equivalent to the one that is added to the array,
  even though they are different objects. Rather than delete and create elements, the existing elements can be moved,
  which is a much simpler and quicker task to perform.
