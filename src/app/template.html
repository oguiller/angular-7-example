UNDERSTANDING MICRO-TEMPLATE DIRECTIVES

Some directives, such as ngFor, ngIf, and the nested directives used with ngSwitch are prefixed with an asterisk, as in *ngFor, *ngIf, and *ngSwitch. The asterisk is shorthand for using directives that rely on content provided as part of the template, known as a micro-template. Directives that use micro-templates are known as structural directives, a description that I revisit in Chapter 16 when I show you how to create them.
Listing 13-3 applied the ngIf directive to div elements, which tells the directive to use the div element and its content as the micro-template for each of the objects that it processes. Behind the scenes, Angular expands the micro-template and the directive like this:

<ng-template ngIf="model.getProductCount() > 4">
  <div class="bg-info p-2 mt-1">
    There are more than 4 products in the model
  </div>
  </ng-template>

You can use either syntax in your templates, but if you use the compact syntax, then you must remember to use the asterisk. I explain how to create your own micro-template directives in Chapter 14.
