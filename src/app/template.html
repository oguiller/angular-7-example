<!--
When the browser triggers an event, it provides an object that describes it. There are different types of event object
for different categories of event (mouse events, keyboard events, form events, and so on), but all events share the
three properties
  - type:      This property returns a string that identifies the type of event that has been triggered.
  - target:    This property returns the object that triggered the event, which will generally be the object that
  represents the HTML element in the DOM.
  - timeStamp: This property returns a number that contains the time that the event was triggered, expressed as
  milliseconds since January 1, 1970.

  The event object is assigned to a template variable called $event, and the binding expression uses this variable to
   access the event objectâ€™s target property.
