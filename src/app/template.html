<!--
An event binding has these four parts:
  - The host element is the source of events for the binding.
  - The round brackets tell Angular that this is an event binding, which is a form of one-way binding where data flows
  from the element to the rest of the application.
  - The event specifies which event the binding is for.
  - The expression is evaluated when the event is triggered.
